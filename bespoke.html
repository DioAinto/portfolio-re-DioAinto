          <h2>About</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">What is bespoke design? Well anything bespoke is “custom made”, “made to order”. It's anything that has been designed specifically with you in mind, a product that has been created and crafted to meet you or your companies specific needs.
           </p>
		  <p class="lead mb-5">On bespoke desing, we each had a user to research. We did interview, learned about them as much as possible in order to design the best possible product for them. Also we each had a partner that did the same. After researching both our users we had to came up with a persona of our user's combinations. This is what we came up with.

		  <p class="lead mb-5"> Karen is 22 years old female UXD student. She is from the Netherlands although she is half German. Karen is a person who values personal effort and meaning in a gift and not how much it costs. For her it's important the emotions and feelings felt upon the gift experience. She seeks a digital gift experience that she relates to and triggers the aspects that are important for her, such as meaningful and personal. Therefore, it is essential to design a system which supplies a virtual personalised experience as well as a meaningful one.  

  We will be designing a unique gift receiving experience for Karen who is missed by her friends in Germany. It's important to implement aspects of what Karen values in order to make the gift receiving experience more memorable and meaningful. To make the gift giving experience more personal, letters or small notes are essentials, it shows effort and thoughts, all important things for Karen. It is therefore, necessary to design a token and a topic which resemble Karen's hobbies and preferences also which gives a meaningful and personal experience.

		   <h4>Card personalization tool: 
		   </h4>
		    <p class="lead mb-5">
			 For Karen's friends in Germany it's important to be able to express themselves on how they feel about Karen and have a great time expressing their feelings. They have to experience excitement and anticipation for all the meaningful and personal messages and experiences they put into the gift. The Card personalisation tool has to be easily accessible and user friendly, with clear navigation and steps. It has to offer some sort of engaging factors and unique experiences.  
			</p>
			<h4>Digital unwrapping: 
			</h4>
			<p class="lead mb-5">Karen is going to experience the feelings of excitement and anticipation but also gratitude when receiving and unwrapping her gift digitally. She would value the experience more if the gift is connected to something meaningful to her and it has been personalised with small details such as cards or notes. Karen would feel tremendous happiness if the intangible gift is in an experience and brings unforgettable memories. Therefore, it is essential that the digital unwrapping conveys the feelings of meaning, personal effort and brings in unique and unforgettable experiences.
