          <p class="lead mb-5">What is bespoke design? Well anything bespoke is “custom made”, “made to order”. It's anything that has been designed specifically with you in mind, a product that has been created and crafted to meet you or your companies specific needs.
           </p>
		  <p class="lead mb-5">On bespoke desing, we each had a user to research. We did interview, learned about them as much as possible in order to design the best possible product for them. Also we each had a partner that did the same. After researching both our users we had to came up with a persona of our user's combinations. This is what we came up with.
